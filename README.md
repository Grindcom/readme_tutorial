## How to make effective readme documents

### Some useful markdown
[More markdown can be found here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
You can also find a cheat sheet [here](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
As well as a more advanced look at GitHub writing [here](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)

1. Headers, or h1 to h6 tags use the # character
  * # \<h1\>
  * ##\<h2\>
  * And so on
2. To make **bold** add two asterisk \*\*before and after the word or phrase\*\*.
3. To make _italic_ use \_ before and after the word or phrase.
4. To use actual code tags surround with back ticks \`
5. Ordered lists are represented by a number followed by a period (5\.).
6. Un-ordered lists start with a \*, Note that if you want an un-ordered bullet list as a sub-set of an ordered number, you have to indent before the \*.

## Convensions
Markdown files - like this readme - should be named as  \<filename\>.md
